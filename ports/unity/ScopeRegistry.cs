// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The scope registry, for Unity / C#. THE SHARED SOURCE.
//
// Authored in expr/ports/unity and VENDORED into each consuming package by
// expr/scripts/vendor-ports.mjs. Do not edit a vendored copy: CI regenerates
// it and fails on `git diff --exit-code`.
//
// Port of @wildwinter/scoperegistry's ScopeRegistry
// (expr/packages/scoperegistry/src/index.ts, 0.7). A game has ONE registry: it
// holds every property from every engine in the game as a set of named scopes,
// each either OWNED (a property bag this registry stores and saves) or FOREIGN
// (values the game keeps and lends through a resolver, never stored here). It
// is held to packages/scoperegistry/corpus.json, which every copy of the
// registry runs.
//
// What the family must provide before this is included: its value type, its
// error type, and the shared PropertyBag, OrderedMap, Expr and Ast. Everything
// else the registry needs (the resolver interface, the spec types, the row
// type, the options) is declared here, so neither family carries a copy.
//
// Not ported, on purpose: the deprecated owned-state fragment
// (saveFragment / loadFragment / OwnedStateFragment / SAVE_FRAGMENT_VERSION),
// which no engine called and which the TypeScript package removes at its next
// breaking release, and toSchema, which no native runtime validates with.
