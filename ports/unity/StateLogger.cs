// The state logger's product-agnostic core, shared by both product families.
//
// Property logging is PUSH-based on the PropertyBag audit hook: every write, engine or host,
// arrives with its previous value and logs the moment it lands. A diff is kept for what has
// no hook - a product's non-property state (turns, cooldowns, visit counts) arrives through
// the adapter's Extra provider and is compared on Capture(), as do bag values replaced
// wholesale by a load, which fires no events.
//
// A diff alone is strictly weaker, which is why this shape won: it can only report the NET
// change between two captures, so a value that changed and changed back is invisible to it,
// and every write is reported late.
//
// Line format: `${label}${path}: ${from} -> ${to}`, `<unset>` for null.
// Port of @wildwinter/scoperegistry's state logger (expr/packages/scoperegistry/src/state-logger.ts).
