# ScopeRegistry - the scope registry / runtime state container, for Godot. THE
# SHARED SOURCE, a port of @wildwinter/scoperegistry's ScopeRegistry (0.7.0).
#
# Authored in expr/ports/godot and VENDORED into each consuming addon by
# expr/scripts/vendor-ports.mjs. Do not edit a vendored copy.
#
# ONE REGISTRY PER GAME. It holds the game's state as a set of named scopes, each
# either OWNED (a property bag this registry reads, writes, lists and saves) or
# FOREIGN (resolved by the game or another engine at runtime, never stored or saved
# here), and builds the eval context the shared evaluator consumes. A game that
# combines engines hands every engine the same registry; each engine registers its
# bags under keys of its own choosing and says, per evaluation, which key a token
# means (aliases).
#
# Declarations are Dictionaries, as the shared property bag takes them:
# {"name", "type", "default"?, "values"?, "stages"?, "writable"?}.
#
# Foreign resolvers are Dictionaries: {"get": Callable(name) -> value | null,
# "set"?: Callable(name, value)}. Omit "set" for a scope nobody may write.
#
# ERRORS. GDScript has no exceptions, so each operation the TypeScript package lets
# throw reports its refusal in its return value, and push_error()s it as well:
#   - define_owned, mount_owned, define_foreign, remove, set_value and reseed_owned
#     return a String: "" on success, else the TypeScript message word for word;
#   - read_scope_registry_spec returns {"ok": true, "spec": Dictionary | null} or
#     {"ok": false, "error": message};
#   - to_eval_context returns the context, or {"error": message} for an alias to a
#     key nobody registered;
#   - owned_bag returns the bag, or null.
# Nothing is changed by a refused call. The messages are part of the contract: the
# registry corpus matches them as substrings, in every language.
#
# NO `class_name`. Godot registers class_name in a PROJECT-WIDE namespace, so a shared
# file claiming one would collide the moment a game installed two addons that vendor it.
# Each family wraps this in its own `class_name` shim; identity belongs to the installing
# plugin, never to the shared source. See expr/docs/port-sharing.md.
#
# Not ported, on purpose: the deprecated save fragment (saveFragment, loadFragment,
# OwnedStateFragment, SAVE_FRAGMENT_VERSION), since versioning belongs to the save that
# embeds the values; and toSchema, since a runtime evaluates and never validates
# authored text.
