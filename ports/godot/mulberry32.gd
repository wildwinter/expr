# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# mulberry32 - the contractual PRNG, for Godot. THE SHARED SOURCE.
#
# Authored in expr/ports/godot and VENDORED into each consuming addon by
# expr/scripts/vendor-ports.mjs. Do not edit a vendored copy.
#
# NO `class_name`: Godot registers those project-wide. Each family wraps this in
# its own thin class_name shim.
#
# A fixed, published algorithm that both product families need and neither owns.
# Port of @wildwinter/expr's prng.ts. Worked in unsigned 32-bit by masking with
# & 0xffffffff at every step, matching JavaScript's `>>> 0` and Math.imul;
# GDScript ints are 64-bit, so the masks keep us in range.

## seed is a `number`, and an int parameter silently loses every seed outside
