# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The bundle export plugin, for Godot. THE SHARED SOURCE.
#
# Authored in expr/ports/godot and VENDORED into each consuming addon by
# expr/scripts/vendor-ports.mjs. Do not edit a vendored copy.
#
# WHY THIS IS SHARED, when it is only a dozen lines of engine boilerplate.
#
# The importer turns a compiled bundle into a Resource so the Inspector has
# something to draw. That alone changes what ships: Godot exports the imported
# product, and `FileAccess.get_file_as_string("res://game.<ext>")`, which is how
# a game loads a bundle, then reads NOTHING in an exported build.
#
# That shipped, in Patterplay 0.4.3 (patterkit/patter#45): an empty read and a
# cutscene that never advanced. The Storylet Engine had the same importer and no
# export plugin, so it had the same bug waiting for its first export, and the
# fix was written a second time by hand. One bug, found once, fixed twice. That
# is the whole argument for this file existing once.
#
# So the editor gets its Resource and the build gets its file: the original
# bytes go back at the original path, and skip() drops the imported copy.
# Without the skip a pack carries the whole story twice (measured at 7.2 MB
# against 3.6 MB for a 3.4 MB bundle).
#
# NO `class_name`: Godot registers those project-wide. Each addon subclasses
# this and fills in the three things that differ.
