# @wildwinter/expr-specificity - for Godot. THE SHARED SOURCE.
#
# Authored in expr/ports/godot and VENDORED into each consuming addon by
# expr/scripts/vendor-ports.mjs. Do not edit a vendored copy.
#
# NO `class_name`: Godot registers those project-wide, so a shared file claiming
# one would collide the moment a game installed two addons that vendor it. Each
# family wraps this in its own thin class_name shim.
#
# This is a PURER shared thing than the evaluator: no value type, no dialect, no
# scopes. Just an AST walk plus a truthiness callback the host supplies, which
# is exactly why truthiness being host policy does not stop it being shared.
