# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The bundle Inspector view, for Godot. THE SHARED SOURCE (the frame only).
#
# Authored in expr/ports/godot and VENDORED into each consuming addon by
# expr/scripts/vendor-ports.mjs. Do not edit a vendored copy.
#
# What is shared is the FRAME: build the widgets, hold the selection, clear and
# redraw, and the two states that are not about content at all - nothing
# selected, and a bundle that failed to load. Those were character-identical in
# both addons, INCLUDING the text a person reads.
#
# What is NOT shared is `_render`, which is the whole point of the view: one
# family shows boxes, decks, cards, hands and tag groups, the other shows
# locales, strings and characters. Subclasses override it and nothing else.
#
# The frame is worth sharing because this exact pair has already drifted. The
# Unreal equivalents of these two files diverged on precisely the error state:
# Patterplay learned to distinguish "failed to load" from "never parsed" and
# say so either way, and the Storylet Engine did not, so an unparsed bundle
# showed a blank Inspector there rather than a fault. Same two files, same
# state, one improved and one left behind.
#
# NO `class_name`: Godot registers those project-wide. Each addon subclasses
# this and gives it one.
