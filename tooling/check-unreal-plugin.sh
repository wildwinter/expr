# Compile the __EXPR_FAMILY__ UE plugin modules for real, with Unreal.
#
# The standalone TestHost (ports/unreal/TestHost/build.sh) compiles the std-only
# core with clang and runs the corpus. It does NOT compile the UE-dependent
# plugin modules: the Runtime module's Unreal-facing half, the Editor module, or
# the demo. Those need Unreal, so a green TestHost is not evidence that the
# plugin builds.
#
# NO LICENCE SECRET IS INVOLVED. An installed Unreal compiles from the command
# line, which is what this does. A GitHub-hosted runner has no Unreal on it at
# all, which is why .github/workflows/ports.yml cannot run this; a self-hosted
# runner on a machine with Unreal runs this script as it stands.
#
# Usage:  ./scripts/check-unreal-plugin.sh
#         UE_ROOT=/path/to/UE_5.7 ./scripts/check-unreal-plugin.sh
