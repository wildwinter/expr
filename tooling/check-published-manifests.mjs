// THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR, from both families on 2026-09-27. A commit moved the JS runtime's
// range on @wildwinter/scoperegistry from ^0.7.0 to ^0.8.0 without a new runtime version, because
// the runtime's version comes from `npm run bump:play` and that release had not been cut. The
// dialect's new range went out on the next library publish; the runtime's did not. npm then served
// runtime 0.14.0 on ^0.7.0 beside dialect 0.2.1 on ^0.8.0, every install got two copies of the
// registry, and a game's ScopeRegistry stopped being the type the runtime used. The repo looked
// fixed the whole time: it said ^0.8.0 under 0.14.0, and nothing compares the repo with npm.
//
// This does. It runs inside `npm run release`, just before `changeset publish`, so a library publish
// cannot go out while another public package in the family is stale on npm. It compares the fields
// that decide an install (dependencies, peerDependencies, optionalDependencies) for every public
// package whose version is already on npm. A version not yet on npm is about to publish, and is fine.
//
// The fix it asks for is always a new version: a changeset for an ordinary package, the runtime set's
// own release for the lockstep member(s) named below.
