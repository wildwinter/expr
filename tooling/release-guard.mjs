// THE FAILURE THIS EXISTS FOR, from Patterplay on 2026-08-18: two published packages both
// gained a feature, went to main with no changeset, and the Release workflow ran green in
// 44 seconds having published nothing. That is worse than a missed release. The registry
// keeps serving one build while the repo at that version number holds different source, so
// a version number stops identifying a build - and nothing anywhere goes red, because
// publishing nothing is a legitimate outcome for that workflow.
//
// A `changeset-check` on pull requests cannot catch it. Both families work directly on
// main, so the check has to run on the push path, which is what this does.
//
// ONE PACKAGE (OR PAIR) IS NOT ORDINARY. The JS runtime named below is the JS member of the lockstep
// runtime set, versioned by `npm run bump:play` together with the Unity, Unreal and Godot
// ports, because one version number has to mean one runtime behaviour across all four. A
// changeset naming it would bump it out of step with three ports that never had that
// version, so naming it is an error of its own, and changing it is reported as a note.
//
// Packages that are `private` AND `ignore`d never publish, so their source moves freely.
// It takes both: `ignore` keeps a package out of versioning, `private` keeps it out of the
// registry, and a public package sitting at 0.0.0 is one workflow run from being on the
// registry forever.
